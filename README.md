# Ross Ice Shelf Icequakes: Download, Detection, Association, Location, and Visualization

This repository contains the complete code for the Ross Ice Shelf Icequake Fracture Mechanics project. The user can follow this entire process from Jupyter notebooks in the top level directory, starting with `data_download.ipynb`. As progress on this project continues, new notebooks will be added for each step of the process.
